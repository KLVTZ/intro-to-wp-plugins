Do your homework
================
- Does this plugin exist?
	- Most implementations may be more complicated than what you need
- Does it fill a need?
	- We end up building a plugin that others may want to use.
- Do the existing alternatives solve your issue?
	- plugins may be out-of-date
	- or they over-complicate the main goals

No matter what your plans are, always see what is out there. Wordpress is loaded
with hooks and actions, we should be aware of functions that already exist in
wordpress.
