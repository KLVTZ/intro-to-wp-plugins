Why use a plugin?
=================
You may think you can add all your features to a theme's `function.php`. Plugins
extend the functionality of wordpress. Themes, however, are only responsible for
the front-end or theme of the wordpress environment. If you add a function to a
themes folder, it will have to be added to another theme if you switch. That is
why plugins are specific for extension --seperated from theme development.
Keeping functionality, even when switching themes. As a result, plugins can be
de-activated and isolated.
