Does the world need another plugin?
===================================
Before you head on to develop the next kick-ass extension for your wordpress
app, check to see if a solution already exists. If you thought about it, chances
are someone else has too. Most solutions can be found. But if none exist, then
this would call for a custom plugin.

If a repo is out-of-date, consider it's functionaity and use. If interested, you
may want to inherit the project and maintain it yourself. Especially if it will
benefit the community.
