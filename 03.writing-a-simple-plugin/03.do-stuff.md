Do Stuff
========
Wordpress uses hooks to run actions at a certain points or events occur.

Actions
-------
- Actions are the hooks that the WordPress core launches at specific points
  during execution, or when specific events occur.
- [Action Reference](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference)

```php
	do_action('before_doing_stuff');
	add_action('before_doing_stuff', 'my_function');
```

Filters
-------
- Filters are hooks that WordPress launches to modify text of various types
  before adding it to the database or sending it to the browser screen
- [Filter Reference](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference)
- There has to be a filter that exists before interaction

```php
function filter_profanity($content) {
	$profanities = ['badword', 'alsoverybad']; 
	return str_ireplace($profanities, '{censored}', $content);
}

add_filter('the_content', 'filter_profanity');
```

Rule of Thumb: if you want to do something, use an action. If you want to
change text, use a filter.

What if you don't want your users to add anything to their code for a plugin to
execute? A simple example would be to load a javascript file base on a selection
made in  admin page. The action of `wp_head` will linke to a function to
determine which page to load the javascript base on selection.

`wp_enqueue_script()` is the optimal way to add scripts to JS. This allows us to
minify files and add it to the project without conflict. This is most apparent
in jQuery files that are loaded.
