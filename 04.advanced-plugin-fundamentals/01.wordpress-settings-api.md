WordPress Settings API
======================
This has been around since 2.0. It has been around to and new settings and
options for a plugin. Some settings include:

- `register_setting('my_cool_setting', 'some_setting')`


We can implement such a register by:

```php
function my_settings() {
	register_setting('my_cool_setting', 'some_setting');
}
add_action('admin_init', 'my_settings');
```

You can unregister settings by de-activating hooks and registers by
`unregister_setting`.
